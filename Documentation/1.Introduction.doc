In apache/conf/zoo_sample.cfg copy this file in same directory with name zoo.cfg

In terminal go to this directory 
PS D:\HDD Data\A Disk\CODE\Visual Studio Code\GitHub\Zookeeper\apache-zookeeper-3.8.4\bin> 

To Change Path in terminal
D:
cd "HDD Data\A Disk\CODE\Visual Studio Code\GitHub\Zookeeper\apache-zookeeper-3.8.4\bin"

In Power Shell
Set-Location "D:\HDD Data\A Disk\CODE\Visual Studio Code\GitHub\Zookeeper\apache-zookeeper-3.8.4\bin"
OR

•zkServer
If Every thing is working fine you wil get 
ZooKeeper audit is disabled.

Now Open New Terminal in Same Path
•zkCli

If Everything is OK You wil get this
WATCHER::
WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:None path:null zxid: -1
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0]
 

Now Continue in same zkCli(Client) terminal
•ls /

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] ls /
[zookeeper]

•create /zk_test my_data

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 1] create /zk_test my_data
Created /zk_test

let's try to delete the node by issuing:
•delete /zk_test

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 5] delete /zk_test
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 6] ls /
[zookeeper]
